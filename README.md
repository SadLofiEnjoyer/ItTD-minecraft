# ItTD-minecraft
Turns images into .mcfunction files that spawn text displays

# Installation:
## Linux:
Unzip the archive and run ./ImageToTextDisplay in terminal
## Windows:
No archive for now, but you can download the source code and use auto-py-to-exe to compile it. And do not forget to download a datapack from the sources as well and put it in the same folder as the application.
# Usage:
Put the images in the same folder as the executable and run it. You will be able to choose how many pixels should fit in a width of one block(simply enter the number of pixels) and then the datapack will be ready. Use /function ittd:(the name of the image) and the image will be spawned.
# Limitations:
* Only .png(for now)
* No transparency support(just replaces fully transparent pixels with gray ones)
* I am not exactly sure how big of an image can be spawned, but a 235 x 169 image was giving my pc a tough time so I dont recommend to import images bigger than that.
